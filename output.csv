23,"Then\, there are various fossilization mechanisms. I couldn't find any good information about the rates of said mechanisms\, so I thought this thread might start some good debate on the subject because of that. Now\, how long did the fossilization take? Did it take 10 or 10\,000 or 10\,000\,000 years? Are the fossils we see all the result of one big 'tragic'event for all\, or little 'tragic'events for each?

I haven't made excuses for him or denied what he did. OP said he is a conservative Christian which is a lie and I'm exposing that lie for what it is.

4610,"The founding fathers did not envision or want the all-seeing\, all-knowing Federal government that you worship today. Nope. That government is best which governs the least\, because its people discipline themselves. -Thomas Jefferson Restrictive? Where do you live? Britain? That would explain a lot.

'' When the people fear the government you have liberty   - Thomas Jefferson Again.. if you're so convinced that gun-control works\, then why do n","A sign like that would hardly be nessecary where I live. We have very restrictive gun-laws and hardly anyone owns a gun. And no\, people does not discipline themselves."
4611,"You are in a loud minority\, railing against the irrational hoards about you.","Being in the minority or in the majority is irrelevant. Belief has no bearing on reality."
4612,"I just became aware of a new movement : http : //www.godnotguns.org/ And\, it made me aware of a very  XXXXX  conundrum in the philosophy of the right\, their ceaseless screaming or babbling about : Gays! God! Guns! I had the realization that to the radically religious rightwing wingnuts\, Guns are God Almighty. This applies to radically rightwing Islamists who want to destroy non-Muslims as well. I 'd bet that all of these nuts have altars devoted to their guns","Actually\, Simone\, if you spend more time on their website and research a little deeper\, you will find that they are also  right wing wingnuts  but they happen to want  sensible  gun policies in order to eliminate violence"
4613,"have you printed your name on the inside waistband of you dungarees yet so when you pull your head out from where the sun don't shine you 'll know who the heck you are?","So are we to understand you had a healthy sexual relationship with a man?"
4649,"The fossil record is remarkably complete\, and the mechanism of the evolution of the Polar Bear from the Brown Bear remarkably clear.","The result was a litter of hybrid offspring. It seems that polar bears and brown bears are perfectly interfertile. Not only that\, it has been shown that the offspring are also interfertile with either species."
4650,"Does the term  evolution  refer to ONLY the  advances  of life over time?","Depends on the usage. Generally\, it just refers to the Theory of Evolution or a change in allele frequencies in a population."
4651,"What's the difference between humans and chimps? According to the blowhards in the scientific world for the past 60 years\, they said it was genetic mutations.","The article is saying that it was genetic changes. Changes in genes encoding certain transcription factors is what caused changes in the expression of other genes."
4652,"I believe you should have a steady hand\, firm grip\, calm breath\, and a smooth pull.","Very well put."
4653,"You do realize that the rules are supposed to be absurd\, to point up the absurdity of a recent court ruling\, right?","NO I mean every word of what I type. If they institute these rules I will back off gay claim to marriage and accept that marriage is about children."
4654,"I wonder how a modern court would view the testimony of 500 credible witnesses to a supernatural event?","A modern court requires signed affidavits or sworn testimony."
4655,"Do you believe that\, if we have the technology\, we should resurrect the dead to walk the Earth as zombies?","good question."
4712,"I would be interested in know who was the first creationist to finally accept that natural selection is a real phenomenon\, and when they accepted it.","By the way\, I do believe that natural selection was accepted before Darwin. It was believed that natural selection killed the  freaks  and ensured that a population of organisms stayed the same ; in other words\, I think I recall that it was originally believed that natural selection kept populations from changing."
4713,"So? He had a shotgun. You're saying that if it were legal to these Indians that would have solved the problem?","Yes that would solve the problem wouldn't it\, worked the first time around\, I say that because we ( U.S. ) are compared to the wild west."

4736,"Abortion does not fit the definition of murder.","If you define a fetus as a child\, as AMD seems to by his/her statement\, then yes\, it does fit the definition."
4737,"But to take the Apostle's analogy further\, if I see something\, and know what it is\, and you can't measure it\, because you weren't there\, doesn't make what I see false... as you seem to suggest that in the physical world truth is what can be measured/tested.","Again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. Whatever your apostle tells you\, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. It can deny that it isn't science if it can not be explained by naturalistic observation."
4738,"Umpteen scientific disciplines can be dwarfed by emotion and money\, both of which saturate evolutionary study.","Because it works. How much money is pumped into microchip design and production?"
4739,"on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it?","Why so many claims in opposition? I make a single claim\, that can be refuted through logic\, if it's fallacy. But the claim is correct."
4754,"Anyone who sticks to beliefs that a god created the earth just 6\,000 years ago is an XXXXX. People are free to believe that a god created the Earth billions of years ago though without deserving the  XXXXX  label. Hope this clarifies things for you.","Thanks\, Clive\, you're a good sport."
4755,"Possibly\, but also aren't the people most likely to start  legitimate  business selling these drugs the people who are doing it already?","So? Isn't that exactly what we would want : people who conduct legal business instead of illegal business? That means less crime\, even if organized crime is still into other things. Making a drug illicit effectively creates another market for organized crime. Look at alcohol and prohibition. Alcohol was a huge market for organized crime back in prohibition days. How many mobsters or gangs still have distilleries? They only people who operate illegal distilleries nowadays are indepedant brewers in rural areas. When you can get a wide variety of quality-controlled drugs at a licensed store down the road\, no one"
4756,"Whether or not there are innaccuracies in the Bible is hottly debated\, but it is not really the point I was trying to make.","I know you think I was acting emotional with my post and it really is hard to tell whether someone is being emotional over a forum since it is so impersonal."
4757,"They are doing a fine job of trying to convince all of us that their behavior is  normal . TV shows\, movies\, magazines\, etc. are loaded with gay characters as an agenda to make you accept them. Don't buy it! Write to the media and tell them you won't stand for it.","Actually I really don't depend on the entertainment industry to give me a realistic picture of anything."
4758,"There is nothing inherently irrational about the theory of evolution being used to explain life in the physical unviverse\, yet creation begins with an irrational premise\, that we can  know  about the  unknowable .","Actually\, the whole basis for modern science depends on the assumption that the universe was made by a rational creator. Dr Stanley Jaki has documented how the scientific method was still-born in all cultures apart from the Judeo-Christian culture in Europe ( Science and Creation ( Edinburgh and London : Scottish Academic Press\, 1974 ) ). An orderly universe makes perfect sense if it was made by an orderly Creator. But if there is no creator\, or if Zeus and his gang were in charge\, why should there be any order at all?"
4759,"If only she 'd been allowed to have a gun she could have what? Shot or threatened to shoot someone? ''","Shooting people for throwing rocks and eggs at houses that is."
4760,"I'm sure there have been more repeat murderers than innocent people put to death. As far as the cost goes\, is that really an issue?

4761,"100 cities could pass laws to require waiting periods. That would count as 100 gun laws.","And your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source. To contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman."
4762,"Why on earth would a woman come out now\, admit to an abortion she had 30 years ago\, when it was illegal\, and become the focus of unscrupulous media attention for the next year?","She is not going to be punished now for aborting a kid 30 years ago."
4763,"As for the other gods\, well since they don't interact with our world they don't really matter at all.","Very true\, especially since when someone asks  is there a God  they are most likely really asking  does the God in which I believe exist"
4764,"When that occurs is variable.","So why can not juvenile crimes which would otherwise be death penalty eligible be treated on a case-by-case basis?"
4765,"This argument is self-defeating. A theory is not a fact\, no matter how much evidence may support the theory.","Wrong and right. Evolution is both a verified phenomenon and a biological Theory."

Off the blood of your fellow Americans. Shoot down sounds appropriate though."
4767,"religion beliefs and worship : people? s beliefs and opinions concerning the existence\, nature\, and worship of a deity or deities\, and divine involvement in the universe and human life","My outburst was meant to show that even a seven year bombardment of religious propaganda can be ineffective if no reasons whatever are advanced for reaching the conclusions that theists desire."
4789,"The organism can survive in the environment by a loss of genetic information i.e. the loss of a function\, for example the loss of wings of a beatle on a windy island helps it to survive.","Except that your picture is balderdash. I presume that you mean beetle\, since a Beatle is one of the fab four. The wingless beetles of which you speak actually have wings. You seem to speak from ignorance of science while you accuse others of speaking of ignorance of creationism."
4790,"You seem to have trouble creating working links. Here is a corrected link to your quote.","You seem to think one example is the norm."
4791,"Rhodesian man\, in less than 85 years\, ages from approximately 11\,000 years old to up to 400\,000 years old! – all in the name of political correctness. It ’ s the epitome of what they stand for.","In the past 85 years\, dating has drastically improved."
4792,"Creationism is a religion\, and Evolutionism is science. Why would people be teaching religion in a public school. Isnt that illegal?","Apparently not. I live in Utah and every public school has a building on the grounds called the seminary. In seminary class they teach of all things the book of Mormon. A Mormon is basically a financial Christian with a whole other book of incredibly stupid poop in it."
4793,"Its  guess and check method doesn ’ t work as essentially there are infinite different possible explanations available to check and so the chances of coming across the correct one are effectively zero.","But that's not even how  creation science \, or any religiously motivated science works. There is no checking involved - what I mean by that is that answers are always ad hoc."
4794,"Incapable of arguing without relying on the fallacy of changing the subject\, false dichotomies ( if not A\, therefore B )\, and generally unable of actually discussing their beliefs on those beliefs'merits?","You mean Intelligent Design\, and straight forward logical\, rational\, common sense arguments that require reason to move to the next step\, instead of ideological consensus... huh? go figure... Proponents of ID usually don't argue religiosity or scripture\, they let the empirical evidence prove it\, funny... that is what true science has always done. Verify the obvious\, not ignore it in favor of some mindless postulations [ oddly ] convenient to how someone wants to live their life ; amazing how that works out..."
4795,"the biological life of a homo sapien begins when the sperm fertilizes the egg and the newly created zygote begins to reproduce cells.","You do realise that by your definition\, identical twins are the same 'life '?"
4866,"My point in starting the thread is not merely that Christians fall short of their aspirations. No.... this is worse. Because this particular U.S. Senator\, an avowed conservative Christian\, has actively worked to restrict the rights of others to marry\, supposedly in the name of  protecting  or  defending  marriage\, while at the same time undermining his own marriage.","People like this guy\, and Henry Hyde\, Newt Gingrich\, Robert Livingston\, and so many others happen to be right wing republicans.... isn't that peculiar?"
4867,"If you couldn't build on the belief that something will happen\, we 'd be stuck never forming new hypostheses. You may have it backwards.","You really have a strange definition of faith. Scientific laws require reproducible results ( patterns ). That's how they got to be laws."
4868,"Scientists have turned to chickens to help them understand why some people are struck down by severe allergies.","I'm not keen on them describing things as living fossils ( the term is misleading ) the possibilities and implications of this are fascinating."

4894,"I can understand the argument that gun laws may infringe on some individual freedom\, but I don t really understand what the constitution has to do with it. Sure\, its much harder to make a change in the constitution\, but this doesn t really affect wether the change should be done or not.","The difference\, Eddie is simply this. If the Constitution needs to be changed\, the founders instigated a means to do so. Said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done\, has been given much thought and study."
4895,"The authors claim their book is being rejected on political grounds\, '' Koss said.  But these are criticisms of content and quality. ''","The guy sounds like he's trying to make a political argument out of this so he can sell more books."
4896,"Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means.","One important part of the theory of evolution is the hypothesis that natural selection is the major driving force behind it."
4897,"for you to use these primate fossils as any actual evidence at all that a REAL chain of lineage from those ancient primates to modern man exists is impossible to prove.","See above regarding the nature of proof. What other plausible explanation is there?"
4898,"I said God did not tell them the different categories of animals\, I did not say that God deliberately kept information from them.","No\, they are the same. God diliberately kept information fro them because He knew they would not understand\, just like you would deliberately keep information not pertinent to you children because they will not understand."
4899,"It's easy to come up with scenarios where you think a gun is the only escape\, but then there are plenty of alternatives where guns take lives unnecessarily\, be they because children get hold of them\, or nutcases\, or someone who's just had a bad day.","So\, everyone who dies in a stabbing/beating/shooting is just\, stupid? Maybe they wanted to die?"

4925,"I would consider a transitional fossil one which contains parts from both the upper and lower class evolutionary forms it links.","So what's wrong with the lineages provided? Define  melding ."
4926,"Why do I think they are popular books\, and not peer reviewed scientific articles?","Because you know the peer review process is biased. Anything submitted for peer review with a recognizable name like Dembski or Behe will be automatically rejected before the first word is read."
4927,"Can you please provide a cite in the Constitution that supports the notion that a Supreme Court Justice nominee has the power to declare that any case is  settled law  and the subsequent power to make it so?","There's a cure for that. It's called school. Perhaps you should go there....."

4992,"Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others\, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population\, but it can't create any new information.","What are you talking about? Please define information."
4993,"Human's wrote the bible. Not all words in the bible were inspired by God. They are simply fallable man's interpretation of a greater intelligence. Human's little finite minds can not comprehend this greater intelligence in all concepts.","I quite agree. Unfortunately\, not everyone is able to see it as such."
4994,"Where do you get the figure of 500\,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married?","I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only\, but after reading the CBO report\, I see that I wasn't far off."
4995,"The rate of recidivism that produces dead innocent victims by paroled criminals far out weights the number of executed innocent men.","But you are forgetting life-without-parole ( and I do mean WITHOUT parole ). With life without parole\, there is also no recidivism."

4998,"No ownership society for women when they can't even claim autonomy over their own bodies.","Which is precisely why the law must needs be silent when it comes to women choosing whether or not to continue their pregnancies."
5062,"Which is why he was found guilty... I don't think you will find many reasonable people thinking it should be anything different.","While I'm not going to consider Dr. Tiller a pillar of society\, I'm certainly not going to condone his murder."

5227,"Why so many what?","different spins on the data depending upon your socio-political background."
5228,"The reason I post this is not to proclaim that evolution is dead or anything like that.

5351,"why do we not find strata with species from all eras mixed together?","most fossils found are surface finds -- which means anything found on the ground probably contradicts uniformitarian principles because every fossil found laying on the ground probably -- according to ToE -- did not die at the same time."

5613,"Why do we put up with this? It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place without walking through all of that and having no other option but to take it\, walk through it.","At least your husband and yourself survived the adventure. Only one became a victim by the adorably nice people  inside  the building. Ironic. What motivated the evil mean people outside the building?"
5614,"10 % of the population has the power to destroy the other 90 % somehow. We can't be in the military because we have the power to undermine things\, we can't get married cause we will destroy marriage for everyone\, we can not possibly have committed relationships because it would make Britney look bad","Yes.... 10 % of the population has a disorder ( homosexuality ) that they refuse to deal with in the proper way do to the fact they believe that the majority should just except there so called  sexual orientation  and treat it like it is as normal as a traditional relationship between a man and a woman."

5654,"Normal folks\, people who are not just trying to * * * * on somebody elses religon or force their religon down somebody elses throat seem to be pushing for a secular and neutral classroom. This is not an unobtainable goal.","But it is OK to teach your religion in public school classrooms?"

5706,"If it is moral for a mother to deny her child the necessities of life ( through abortion ) before it is born\, how can she be obligated to provide the same necessities after he's born?","This is a false assertion. In our society\, a woman is not obligated to care for a child after it is born\, this is why adoption and safe-haven laws exist."
5707,"Catholicism tends to be even more strict and loony than Christianity.","I believe you are thinking of orders\, not denominations. There is a big difference. Strict and loony? Could you be a little more specific\, because this statement sounds like it's coming out of complete ignorance."

5711,"If it's wrong then prove why it wrong.","Well\, I thought I did. Perhaps you didn't understand. We can look at the rings of a tree to determine how old it is. We can also determine other things\, such as relative lengths of growing seasons and times of catastrophies. If I were to cut down a tree just after it was  created\,  I would be able to infer a growth pattern and relative seasonal information.. even though there was no growth pattern and there were no seasons. In the same way\, if we look at a star that is 10 billion light years away\, we are seeing the events that happened at that star"
5712,"I have been thinking recently  What is evolution?  Sounds an easy enough question to answer\, but all of my sources are kind of contradictory. Some say evolution is  X  while others say that evolution is  X+Y . So I am rather confused as to a clear definition. Here is what I define evolution as : Evolution is a three part theory\, we have : 1. Astronomical evolution - the big bang theory. Explains how the universe started. 2 Biological evolution - explains how life supposedly came from non- or lifeless chemicals. 3 Biological evolution -","Evolution only deals with the diversification of life\, not its origins\, and most certainly not the origin of the universe."
5720,"Direct evidence for ID/Creationism has never been established so there is no reason to suppose it to be true.","What you must realize is that is the case for evolution as well\, we don't have enough evidence to know ; this is common in science but it is only the political drive of Darwinism that found that state unacceptable."
5721,"All of the observations that we see today can be explained without creation and evolution! Neither are needed in the explanations.","Actually\, creation explains nothing. Evolution is an observation that is explained by theories that explain why populations of animals change. One explanation is the theory of natural selection."
5722,"I personally can't imagine a time that it would be absolutly necessary to kill a child\, though there is a lot out there that I can't imagine happening that does.","Confused? First you say you don't believe in killing children unless it's  absolutly ( sic ) necessary \, then you say you can't imagine a time that it would be absolutely necessary. Can't you make up your mind?"
5723,"I support embrionic stem cell research. Of course I support informed consent.","So you're saying all of these people have created a propaganda site? Is this not a legitimate feminist cause?"

5725,"regardless of whether many religions accept evolution\, as it stands\, such does not fill the holes in evolution.","But that doesn't make Creationism correct either."
5726,"Some argue that the mountains weren ’ t that tall yet. That makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift. Plates move at 1 inch a year. That ’ s 500 feet over 6\,000 years.

5736,"Your analysis might be correct\, although I don't think I 'd bet big money on it.","I think this is a fair conclusion. I went as far as I did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session. I may be wrong\, but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken."
5737,"What you mean is that we should pretend that creationism has some sort of legitimate basis in reality?","you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost. first of all\, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives\, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions"
5738,"Abortions hurt much more than they heal. Not just phsyically ( Side effects can occure months afterward ) but psychologically as well. Guilt\, depression\, so forth. In my view\, abortion is murder\, one way or the other and rare extreme cases don't justify its legality.","What I've been saying here\, and after awhile - the guilt\, depression\, etc - will get buried\, deeper & deeper - but no negative/damaging experiences leave people."

5767,"Yeah\, he's absolutely correct. So what's your point? You think you deserve special rights?","This whole riff where people talk about preventing employers from firing gays JUST cause they are gay as a  special right  is something that seems to fool those who are prejudiced against gays...... but for most people\, they recognize it as a propagandic phrasing with little merit."
5768,"If I bear witness of myself\, my witness is not true.","You forgot to fully quote John 8:18. here is the rest : and the Father that sent Me beareth witness of Me.

5839,"evolution is still just a theory for a valid reason. It is untrue and can not be proven. Darwin himself said that his theory would be proven or disproven based on the future discovery of transitional fossils.","JUST A THEORY do u even know what a theory even is?

5874,"How can this be presented as fact rather than theory?","Thankyou for bringing to my attention that atoms\, neutrons and protons are merely scientific assumptions."

6306,"the court wasn't trying to determine whether slavery was a collective or individual right\, or what the constitution applied to in regard to slavery.","Stop moving the goal posts. My point was that the Supreme Court has been wrong before so assuming that the Supreme Court is always correct about an issue is unjustified."
6307,"No\, this is not about abortion\, and I think that is very clear.","Punishment for an action against someone is different then a decision concerning personal health ( or privacy )"
6329,"Genesis 2 is what was passed down through Noah\, in Oral history\, so it would differ slightly\, but that's becaue of man's error\, not God's.","So\, some parts of the Bible are erroneous oral history after all! What a refreshing admission."
6330,"God didn't say this BUT thanks for responding to a post that is over 5 years old.","Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers\, by their families : every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them."
6331,"The Bible says that God created every thing in 6 days. That does not neccensaraly mean it only took 6 days.","So how would you explain fossils\, pro-con?"
6332,"Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex.","Oh it has happened. But that is not a problem with my son\, me or his father - it is a problem for the pathetic hate-mongers who carried out the acts of harrassment."
6333,"I would say no....... I mean if you can believe in God\, the you must believe that He's going to put what he means in the Bible. ''","I believe the question was  who?  I'm christian and I believe in evolution. Whether it contradicts the Old Testament or not makes no difference to me. Jesus contradicted the Old Testament."

6351,"Africans ( Blacks )\, due to the fact that they started evolving later than Europeans and Asians\, are almost 400\,000 years behind these other groups in evolutionary standards. Thus\, they got a late start!","Not really. It just means that Homo erectus was around in Africa 200\,000 and 125\,000 years ago. So some of them stayed around in Africa. What's your point?"
6352,"The Bible even suggests that all Christians have a duty to go and spread the word and attempt to convert others to Christianity.","Jesus never preached that humans should force people to believe as we do."

6358,"Given this\, the question then becomes  who encoded the DNA? ''.","Actually the question is  is DNA close enough to conventional codes to justify the term  code  being applied.

6361,"Gun-law counts are somewhat preposterous though because\, for example\, a single law can regulate numerous disparate subjects.","Damn fine job!"
6362,"However\, at some point the will of the majority should be respected. Otherwise we have no business even calling ourselves a democracy","I think it would be more valid to say  Whenever a decision does not go our way\, the first reaction should not be turn AGAINST the courts...

6401,"When I was in school\, the age was only 4.5 billion years old. What will it be in 10 years? Only God knows\, because no scientist has a clue. Here's my edited post from above. Also\, notice how every link gives a different estimated age. The question is\, whom do we believe? Or should we just not get hung up on such details as we place our faith in the imaginings of dreamers?","So\, what you're saying is we shouldn't look at evidence and refine our methods and calculations when more accurate data allows for more accurate outcomes?"

6403,"If you have a link for that\, please show it\, otherwise I 'll take that as yet another dishonest statement on your part.","So false accusations are now your lie-du-jour?"
6404,"in what way would measuring a decline in field strength over 150 years have to do with its presence for billions of years?","I could imagine someone plotting the data\, making a straight line fit\, then extrapolating back 5000 and 4 billion years\, then waving their hands significantly\, as if the graph proved something."

6427,"Who said anything about blind support?","I guess we just have different approaches then. To me a candidate should be held to questioning and challenged about any public policy issue\, even publicly\, rather than put a 'team mentality'first and not challenge them on a stance because of already wanting them in office -- I tend to decide whether I want someone in office AFTER doing those things rather than before\, and let such challenges play a part in whether or not I put my support behind them. An election is the time one SHOULD challenge them\, not after they're in office and there's nothing that can so easily be done about it."

6436,"materialists claim free will is an illusion\, doesn ’ t actually exist.","Well humans if asked will tell you that they make choices among alternatives and this they may attribute to a capability which one can call free-will. Thats all observable. The question always boils down to just what is the underlying cause or mechanism which results in this property. Some free-will advocates will claim that free-will MUST be non-deterministic since if it were not it would not be  free  that deterministic processes can not lead to choice as they EXPERIENCE it. However this implies a depth of knowledge which they do not have - namely a detailed knowledge of the ins and outs of how their brain works"

6448,"At age 18? That's a possibility - a coworker of mine once expounded that every couple\, with the consent of both parents\, and at their own expense\, should have an unlimited right to abortion all the way up to age 18.","I believe Sinjin is right. Children are citizens once they are born. Citizens are naturalized or natural born."

6519,"You can preach pretty religious philosophy all day long but I ain't buying. Saying that Jesus told you that all life is special doesn't comfort a rape victim\, doesn't provide health care to a woman without it\, doesn't feed a family if a single mom has to quit her job\, doesn't provide an education if she has to quit school.","just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true. that life is sacred does provide a ( if not the only ) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not."
6520,"Dr. Pigluicci doesn ’ t see a difference between the organization of a hurricane and the organization of a living system. Most people do see a difference.","Actually the details of HOW embryogenesis proceeds is becoming increasingly understood."

6525,"The only reason that this was even posted was because it was another attempt to discredit anyone that is against gay marriage.","They should be discredited\, and their hypocrisy should be exposed.

6526,"ERVs in humans match those in apes. ERV = useless code in DNA\, but present in all members of a species Basically it goes like this. Viruses inject their DNA into the hosts DNA.

6584,"Actually\, no\, my understanding is that in most states the law doesn't require this at all. Many doctors take what is known as the Hipocratic oath\, but it's not a legally binding oath.

9459,"The thing I am trying to get at is that there wouldn't be a  you  left to have any concern if all of your mental processes were gone and all that was left was the living body sustained artificially.","It is possible that I\, in a coma\, might be having mental processes in the form of dreams and memories."
9460,"I will agree that atheism can be considered a religion\, after all it is a set of beliefs about the supernatural ( that they don't exist ).","Then surely you can see that happenstance origins taught in science classes on the level that it is today comes dangerously close to violating the establishment clause of the first amendment!"
9461,"Picking an choosing what one likes out of the Bible doesn't mean they know God.","Because bibliolaty doesn't equal Christianity."
9462,"Ill consult some of my friends to help me on these issues if you dont mind.","Sounds good."
9463,"Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket\, a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent.","One wonders if there wasn't an element of racism involved."
9464,"If one agrees to a discussion without using the Bible as some people insist\, then they have set the terms of the debate. In essence these terms are : 1.  Facts ’ are neutral. However\, there are no such things as  ‘ brute facts ’ ; all facts are interpreted. Once the Bible is eliminated in the argument\, then the Christians ’ presuppositions are gone\, leaving them unable to effectively give an alternate interpretation of the facts. Their opponents then have the upper hand as they still have their presuppositions — see Naturalism\, logic and reality.","This is where intuitive\, ready agreement with the opening paragraph starts to get the reader into trouble. All facts are interpreted according to presuppositions\, so it's only fair that Creationists should get to bring their presuppositions to the table just like everyone else\, right?"
9465,"Those children were invading their privacy\, trespassing in their home\, stealing their food.","All born children\, and every woman had the right to be rid of them. Killing them is not required as abortion is when they are in the womb"
9466,"how would YOU have run that poll? Specifically\, how would you phrase a poll to determine people's views about the stage of pregnancy or fetal development they think is morally critical enough to outlaw abortion?","Well\, we should both agree that first off the generally public doesn't exactly know what it thinks a lot of the time."
9467,"Sure\, they were a minority\, but a group with a clear agenda... And they used scientific research to back their case!","So how is misuse of science a valid argument against the correct application of the scientific method?"
9468,"nonsense and here are some quotes.","Those quotes have nothing to do with abortion. This one has to do with babys in the woumb  Befor I formmed you in the woumb\, I knew you\, and before you were born I consecrated you ; I appointed you a prophet amoungst nations  Jeremiah 1:4-5 I think this is rellavent because God wants everyone to be a prophet who he can work through."

9471,"It seems to me the corollary of the phrase  abortion is murder  is  miscarriage is manslaughter \, and that any consistent pro-life advocate must urge any mother who accidentally loses her child due to actions she undertook\, be charged with manslaughter.","Wait a second. What if it is by reason of genetic instability that the baby miscarries?"
9472,"Can anyone explain to me why no other apes\, monkeys or chimps have evolved into a new ( i.e. human ) species?","Because Apes\, monkeys and chimps are on different paths."
9473,"The bishop instructed me not to take Communion and said that he has instructed the diocesan priests not to give me Communion\,  Kennedy said the bishop had explained the penalty by telling him  that I am not a good practicing Catholic because of the positions that I've taken as a public official\,  particularly on abortion.","So the bishops finally did it. They've been threatening to do that for years. Well\, I guess it's time to yank their tax-exempt status from them."
9474,"I've advocated photographing and fingerprinting for all handgun purchases.","Sex offenders who rape and kill children are required to be photographed and fingerprinted. Why are you in favor of people exercising a constitutional right\, being treated in the exact same way?"
9475,"Do you deliberately come up with these innane comments to try and frighten people aware from a decent debate?","Well you haven't proven that you don't support the idea of a dictatorship."
9476,"I hardly think that the sole or most important difference between a blastocyst/foetus/embryo and a born human is their place of residence.","The original statement didn't address anything about the difference between a pre-birth and post-birth human. It was a reasonable statement that suggested that no human being should be discriminated because of their place of residence."
9477,"Either we had a beginning or we did not have a beginning...","This is a false dichotomy. We are limited by the English language on this subject as  beginning \,  before  etc all reference time. Time is just a dimension of space-time however\, thus something could have existed  before  ( in a non-time sense ) the beginning of space-time. So we might have had an absolute beginning\, a partial beginning\, or no beginning."
9478,"opponents of a marriage amendment acted as if defeating Bush would spell the death of such a proposal.","I can't help but wonder if current majority public sentiment against alternative lifestyles\, and other change\, isn't a portion of widespread fear as that public experiences declines in standards of living\, an ongoing threat of Islamic extremist attacks and other social changes that further threaten their status quo."
9493,"A third or fourth eye is simply a copy of an existing body part. If it's a FIRST eye that evolved\, then that 'd count. You can't create anything new by creating copies.","Really. Some people would think I'm in cahoots with the creationists. I predict their behavior and then they go and do it."

9495,"I pointed out the author's bias by assuming it was geneticwithout any demonstrable proof.","He states genetics as a cause twice both times he is quoting a source."
9496,"I put to you that you are the one discriminating on the basis of someone's size and development\, since you would have it that a small\, slightly developed person has a right to inhabit a womb\, while a fully grown adult does not.","This isn't discrimination because the adult once did have have the right to live in a womb until it could live otherwise."
9497,"All organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive.","Humans ( in general ) are actually very careful about protecting their young. Many organisms just produce a few thousand offspring and leave. Obviously\, all of those offspring can not survive."
9498,"If he knows what will happen\, then he can not change what will happen\, and is thus\, not omniscient. These are contradictory.","Not being able to change something would be an indication of not being omnipotent."
9499,"You are betraying your belief system.","Yep. ( I'm assuming that by  belief system \, you mean a methodology of gaining knowledge ) Science depends on evidence."
9507,"Citizens are also protected by giving any evidence against thier will by the 5th Amendment.","Gun registration schemes have been disabled for criminals because requiring them to register a gun they are forbidden to own would violate their 5th Amendment rights."

''","Oh so then Brady got it all wrong according to the VPC. Funny. Brady says the Brady laws are working quite well. Now they are asking me to trust them that they can make it all right?"
9509,"In the theory of evolution\, what did it all start with?","In the theory of evolution\, it all started with life. I know that you have been told that the big bang theory is part of evolution. It's not. The word evolution means change. In some situations it still has a meaning that it had back in Victorian times. It meant change in a particular direction\, as in stelar evolution - stars  evolve  in predictable ways. It also sometimes carries the connotation of progress. But none of these meanings are applicable to theories of biological evolution. There is no concept of purpose or direction to the word when used in a biological context to the word when used in a"
9510,"Is this a diversionary tactic? I don't see any claim being made about those types of weapons being sold in US gun stores.","Not at all\, I'm simply forcing those making the argument to address the undeniable facts."
9511,"Often abortion supporters convey their message as one of championing the cause of freedom of choice and resistance of the oppression of others values on women.","I can't speak for anyone else\, but I support any choice that the woman wants to make. No\, I don't support forced abortions anywhere\, I don't support what's going on in China and India because they're still taking a choice away from the women."
9512,"Why are trying to prove that God exists or does not exist based on the design of our eye?","Except for possible exception of a couple evangelistic atheists\, the design argument is from the creationist side. It is pretty old being first stated by William Paley. Darwin respected Paley and thought his arguments beautiful until he actually started looking at reality"
9513,"The only mind you need to know in this particular thread is your own. The only awareness you need concern yourself with to answer the question  what does it take to change YOUR mind on abortion?  Is Yours.","Why don't you take your own advice? What would it take to change YOUR mind on abortion?"
9647,"The lutheran ceremony is pretty cool just change a few words to gender nutral.","So who do I get to be the official. A minister wouldn't really work and it isn't legal so a judge doesn't work...... so who?"

9649,"Canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or out right illegal depending on just where you life.","Where in Canada is it illegal to defend yourself with a firearm\, given sufficient threat?"
9650,"So why should you care about their non-scientific beliefs in a debate on science?","If a scientist doesn't believe his test results are accurate\, and expects me to place my life savings on his project would that not be pretty stupid."
9651,"you merely prove his point by your prejudicial reaction","I apologize for that statement. I just thought that his air of superiority when he was preaching to be simply sickening."
9652,"The philosophy of experimental science...began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith\, not the knowledge\, that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operation... It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science\, which professionally has little to do with faith\, owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted\, and that science today is sustained by that assumption. ’","Origins of science\, whether truly started by those of faith or not\, is irrelevant. Whatever science was\, it has become a body of knowledge\, through application of reason."
9653,"Just as I predicted. The anti-choicers support this. a.k.a anti-lifers.","Once again you either pervert our opinion or outright lie as you misrepresent our perspective."
9689,"I admit that I don't know the exact scientific definition of a monkey.","So what was the common ancestor of the Old World Monkeys and the Apes\, and what did it look like?"
9690,"You do realize that the vast majority of firearms used in crimes are stolen no?","Proof please."
9691,"My point wasn't to show that the unborn is a person but to show that the real question isn't  Who gets to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy\, the woman herself or some nameless faceless bureaucrat?  but whether or not the unborn is a person.","I think there are two separate questions here. ( 1 ) When does personhood begin? ( 2 ) Who gets to make such arbitrary\, moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman? Both are legitimate issues of contention."
9692,"I'm surprised some YEC didn't already post this in favor of their arguments.","Let ’ s have a look at it – a little pause button action\, a little jotting down and we have it in writing! Atheist scientists ( or Algore ) provided me with this technology\, not sure which."
9693,"I'm not going to get into a religious debate\, but I can appreciate someone taking a religious stance against it. Why do I think it is wrong?","No\, I wasn't looking for religious morality\, I was looking for general morality\, so your argument was the kind I wanted to debate."
9694,"When the needs of the two are in conflict this is unavoidable.","If the baby is in the womb they haven't experience life\, so how can they miss it."
9695,"But this isn't really what I was talking about. Creationists always refer to  random chemical reactions  as if there was anything random about chemical reactions.","Yes you are right : chemical reactions are not random."
9703,"when we believe the gospel\, the Holy Spirit baptizes us into Christ ’ s body\, and our sins are forgiven through His shed blood.","considering how ambiguous and contradictory the Christian scriptures are\, I guess this interpetation makes as much sense as any of the others."
9704,"If you can't eliminate demand you could try to limit supply and control access to that supply.","The Gun Control Act of 1968 lists individuals who're prohibited from firearms ownership or possession\, one of the groups that're prohibited are individuals who've been found guilty of a felony offense."
9705,"Does anyone believe that PRIVATE GUN OWNERSHIP keeps us ( in the U.S. ) free?","Kelvin's already proposed that the armed population of America has given serious protection to the US\, specifically he mentioned Japan deciding not to invade. This is of course a nonsense. Iraq is a heavily armed nation -guns were given out to the general population before the USA invaded - ahem- I mean 'liberated '. Did it stop the US? Secondly\, the specific example given ; that of Japan\, is a nonsense. These same people who refuesed to leave foxholes when starving - and would resort to cannibalism rather than surrender\, he"

The origin of life has nothing to do with the theory of evolution."
9709,"If the evolutionist bible\, the 'Origin of Species'isn't involved\, then I trust science.","So you solely have a problem with the theory of evolution\, but anything in science that doesn't involve this theory seems sound to you. Correct? 2 questions : If you trust the scientific method in the rest of science\, and you feel the processes are sound\, how do you account for the overwhelming acceptance of evolution?"

9718,"Health care is a civil and human right in a democratic society.","Just by being something man made\, this can not be a right. Any right that all humans deserve comes directly from God."

9722,"As I understand\, some people have claimed that the civil war was justified because the people in the southern states were exercising their 2nd amendment right to rebel.","I think that laws\, like history\, are written by the victors."
9723,"at least the court made the correct decision and didn't just try to make new laws.","I don't usually agree with you\, but I agree with you on this one. The judiciary branch is there to interpret the law. Do I wish the ruling had been different and the government should have paid for the abortion? Yes. But the court made the correct decision. It's the same with the Terri Schiavo case. All the conservatives wanted to save her because they thought the laws weren't right but the judges all sided on the side of the law. The law is written for a reason\, and we don't get to decide when to ignore them just because of compassion. Then't get to"
9738,"homosexuals join to practice a religion that hates them just so they can gain access to children.","Let me for a moment frame my blasphemous take on Christianity\, the trinity\, etc. Folks\, you have an Almighty Father God\, the first aspect ; then\, you have a Holy Spirit -- must be male\, wasn't that the entity that impregnated the Virgin Mary? ; thirdly\, the Son\, male of course. No females allowed."
9739,"I really don't think the big pro-life vs pro-choice argument is about where life begins or whether or not life is precious.","I think this is where the pro-life and pro-choice people really get things messed up... Pro-choices views it as you do Jitobear... whether a mothers rights supercedes the childs rights as opposed to a pro-lifer who believes that everyone has the same rights and the question becomes what rights are  on the top  so to speak. In more detail I guess you could say  is it a right or a want and what would be a right and do we have finite rights . Pesonally\, the right to life is kind of the start of every other  right  or"
9740,"As the Christian Right's poster boy\, this is hugely damaging\, don't you think? Also makes him very hypocritical ( or\, dare I say\, a FLIPFLOPPER?! ) since he is campaigning against open abortion now.","I hope I'm not the only person who went directly to your source to check it out. Lets review several points here : 1 ) The need to display current information. This article is almost four years old\, I have yet to hear anything about this over the entire course of Mr. Bush's presidency. George W. Bush is one of the most personally assaulted Presidents in US history\, few will argue this whether they support him or not."
9741,"The justification comes from this being a scientific fact.","But it's not a  fact  unless you've defined what you mean by  person.  If you define  person  as  the combination of a fertilization event\,  then all you have is a meaningless tautology."

9766,"I do not know all that much about peppered moths\, just the story and why it is a fraud and even if it was not\, why it does not support evolution over creation.","You seem to feel that scientists care about  creation  more than they do.

9769,"I don't think anybody will argue that owning a gun prevents crime.","I think some people will and have argued that. I 'll work on finding a quote\, but I believe it was somebody here who argued that\, because of the recent SCotUS ruling\, home invasion in DC would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun."
9770,"The problem is that you have wack jobs and zealots on both sides of the issue. On the one hand\, you have the YEC/creationist crowd.
