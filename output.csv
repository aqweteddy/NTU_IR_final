1,"they do tend to stay with their own.","By your own admission you haven ’ t ’ t 'hung out'with stoners for a while and you're making generalisations about them to people who do spend a lot of time with stoners?"
2,"Be sure to give your guns a big fat kiss tonight before you go to bed tonight 'cuz guns did really good today.","Actually\, they didn't. The whole tragedy was caused by gun control."
3,"One of the biggest arguments against gun control is that if the government became too oppressive\, the people wouldn't have the capacity to carry out a successful rebellion. Of course\, if the government was becoming oppressive\, it would likely implement gun control\, so the absence of gun control is necessary to ensure that we do not take a plunge towards fascism!","Not quite. To be more correct regarding government and guns\, the right to own weapons is for the right to revolt and revolt with violence. Our political philosophy is very clear on this :"
4,"compare the'B'specimen in your fossil link to the modern specimen and point out any significant difference to me.","At your service : Comparison I could've just circled the whole thing\, but this makes it clearer."
5,"There are some incedents that are beyond your control. If you own a rifle or large handgun\, it's at your own risk.","Well yes."
6,"So the answer to your question is that there is no answer.","So which is it : the action is moral\, the action is immoral\, or there is no answer?"
7,"Legality does not matter. Religous implications do not matter. Other peoples moral considerations do not matter.","Exact\, to the point\, & beautiful."
15,"Correctly viewed\, evolution is not a series of unlikely events\, but a series of highly likely ones. It is highly likely\, for instance\, that some bacteria in a large colony would experience a mutation enabling the digestion of nylon.","Well\, that is not what your colleagues quoted herein seem to feel... and that certainly is not what empirical evidence is bearing out. Evolution simply put\, is the creation story for secular humanists and nothing more\, which in and among itself if fine - I don't personally care if believe we evolved from Mountain Dew\, but don't try to pass that off as fact when there is substantial evidence that says otherwise"
16,"Strange\, I was under the impression this article was referring to the Roman Catholic Church.","You're not one of those people who doesn't consider Catholics christians are you?"
17,"And dont you get a kick out of SP calling herself a rational christian as she blasphemes God and attempts to disprove Him in every post?","Actually he doesn't believe in a liar God like you\, so really it's YOU who's the blasphemer. And he's a Christian\, you're a Biblist. He actually follows Christ\, you just try to maintain the credibility of your God-Book."
18,"I wasn't an fortunate as you. It took me a few years to see through the fairy tale of evolution and see that God was the only true creator.","um\, yeah\, you could say that... ( won't argue... left up to the evolution board )"
19,"both sides are in denial and see the other as stupid. only one of them can be right\, or else. hooray! pass the popcorn!","I'm not in denial about anything and don't think Evo's are stupid because they don't agree with me. Obiviously\, things don't work both ways."
20,"Actually\, I strongly disagree with gay marriage anyway. It just isn't marriage. It is hypocritical and just plain disugusting.","Because you say so?"
21,"That gives me an idea. Why don't we have a competition to come up with the best suggestion for a display or show at this theme park?","Oh! mememe! I have an idea! The museum staff hire ( or possibly abduct ) a few evolutionists and put them in stocks."
22,"And I 'd think the explanation would be that oxygen content was much different before the flood","And yet the species that exist today are the exact same as the species during the high oxygen content? That makes little sense. It's like saying the world was vastly different before yet perfectly suited for the species that exist today. That is COMPLETELY nonsensical. Where did all of the oxygen go?"
23,"I couldn't find any good information about the rates of said mechanisms\, so I thought this thread might start some good debate on the subject because of that. Now\, how long did the fossilization take? Did it take 10 or 10\,000 or 10\,000\,000 years? Are the fossils we see all the result of one big 'tragic'event for all\, or little 'tragic'events for each? Any thoughts","Well\, Google is your friend here - try fossil and see what you get. Alternatively click the link in my sig and look in the archive section at Talk Origins. It is not possible to break fossilisation down into such simple notions as  one big preservation event  and lots of  little preservations ."
24,"Do you mean sexually molesting children? Again\, I think that harms and forces something on someone.","What if a 13 year old girl comes up to you and asks for sex\, and you agree? Are you forcing yourself on to her?"
25,"And the king of Babylon smote them and put them to death at Riblah\, in the land of Hamath-thus Judah was exiled from its land. Rather\, a sceptre refers exclusively to rulership\, not political independence\, as seen in the following passage.","You didn't bother to read the link\, I see\, which said :  During the 70-year Babylonian captivity\, from 606-537 B.C.\, the southern kingdom of Israel\, Judah\, had lost it's national sovereignty\, but retained it's tribal staff or national identity."

27,"Where is the evidence for an American-style  culture of fear  in India?","So are you saying that the people of India aren't upset about what happened and how the police chose to hide instead of engage the enemy and thus let hundreds of people be violently murdered?"
28,"Viva La Liberty!","I see you Americans deal as loosely with the French and Spanish languages\, as you do with English! Surely it is something like Viva Libertad\, or Vive la Liberte\, but Viva La Liberty??????????????"
43,"Abortion is a lucrative gold mine.","From that site :"
44,"Senior citizen yachties stand little chance of defending themselves against pirates. Piracy needs to be dealt with using military might.","And you think the British would do that?"
45,"I ’ m against gay marriage and have been happily married for 31 years\, thereby disproving your BS. NEXT!!! Do you think that being allowed to marry your favorite sheep would undermine the institution of marriage?","Ahah! The exception that proves the rule!"
46,"With a shotgun and his dog\, he tried to defend his Caledonia home - The Globe and Mail","What can ya expect when they killed free speech in favor of hate speech tribunals?"
47,"And the only reason the criminals hold handguns is because of the ban.","Criminals have always had guns ban or not"
48,"Show me even one instance of the National media coming out with a story that questioned Darwinism or explained the other side of the debate.","Scientists pick holes in Darwin moth theory by Robert Matthews in the Sunday Telegraph ( March\, 1999 ) I'm not sure what you mean by the other side of the debate\, though. ID? EAM? YEC?"
49,"Well\, the type of atheism you are talking about here requires faith. If you say  I know there is no god\,  this statement requires faith. You have not observed anything that would lead you to reason or deduce that there must not be a god.","I know what I think the difference is\, but I need to know what you mean when you say  I understand that there is definitely no god.  Personally\, I understand that we have no verification one way or another. All I know is that I don't know one way or the other."
50,"Do you know who mai'ana is?","You're right\, I think he has made such comments. Sorry. I think he's wrong and went too far."
51,"The Filipinos are very live and let live kind of people. These are Muslim extremest who don't cotton very much to the Christian Government. The Filipinos usually just leave them alone. From time to time they reek havoc.","Just so you don't shoot them!"
52,"I didn't have to CHOOSE to be heterosexual. It's the natural inclination\, unlike homosexuality.","And I didn't have to choose to be homosexual. It is a natural inclination. I chose not to hide or lie about who I am."
53,"Yes\, how terrible it is to live in a country that gives a woman liberty over her own body.","What I find hard to believe is that politicos will place their decision above the health of a woman ; only for political expediency."
54,"I would have to say that whoever told you about'macro-evoution'from a science perspective obviously did not explain things properly.","Actually what sank that debate was a bunch of paleontologists from K state who started arguing for punctuated equilibrium."
55,"No Montalban\, fallacy or falsity will not persuade me to think a true claim is false. Your faith can not differentiate truth from falsity\, so we can not use your faith-based evidence\, since it always results in circular reasoning\, and ultimately\, contradiction. If you wish to support your refutation with logical or justified evidence\, please do. You have not. -M","The cultic flaw in Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism is not in the use of reason\, or in the emphasis on individuality\, or in the belief that humans are self motivated\, or in the conviction that capitalism is the ideal system."
56,"What some courts have done is to say that such a definition violates some part of the Constitution.","And if one accepts that gay citizens have equal rights under that Constitution\, then one has to accept that a ban on gay marriage is intrinsically unconstitutional."
64,"So does this mean they have to get tougher on gun control or softer before the results go their way?","So then will you go the way on liberty ( repeal stoopid laws ) or tyranny ( enact more unconstitutional laws )?"
65,"Washington\, DC -- Christopher Bryan Speight\, the 39-year-old man who allegedly shot and killed eight men and women yesterday in Appomattox\, Virginia\, is at least the 12th person licensed to carry a concealed handgun reported to have committed a mass shooting since May 2007 according to Violence Policy Center ( VPC ) research.","That's far too small a number to justify your position."

69,"For instance the Yucca plant has a moth that waits dormant for 80 to 150 years beside it to pollinate it on the one day it blooms in all that time. How did that evolve? Or was IT that did it?","What are you talking about? A dog can't have a cat. That's retarded."
70,"Simple... evolutionary science is science and creationism is not? How does creationism even meet the science standards... well it does not. Creationism assumes god\, therefore it can not be a science.","oh ye of little faith..... i pity you"
71,"But man is inherently\, biologically social\, at the level of the family and the tribe. Daniel Boone\, moving further into the wilderness whenever he could see the smoke from someone else's cabin\, or solitary hermits in the desert\, are quite rare\, and even they are dependent on the rest of society for sustenance.","Don't tell me\, tell the darwinists!!"
72,"And since when was there a dichotomy between freedom and socialism?","Since the words had meaning."
73,"The truth is out there...","And amongst us"
74,"Your question itself is a problem. God is 'He who is '\, not a 'what '.","God does not fill the word  who  because to most accounts he is not a person\, or being. But for your sake I will restate the question. Who is God? Describe God to me. What is that you believe in?"
75,"The atheist has always maintained that there was no beginning.","Many ( all? ) other religions have the idea of a creation event by one or more gods at the beginning. Why would the author single out just one religion and ignore all others?"
76,"Gay marriage is outlawed in Texas and many other states. It's not a  right  around these parts\, and never will be.","Actually\, gay marriages will probably be recognized everywhere in the US within a decade or so. They may not be performed everywhere\, but they will be recognized."
77,"I think the main pro-life argument from the libertarian camp is that pro-life laws are a form of  negative intrusion\,  just like laws against murder\, rape or theft.","It's still the same argument. A fetus is a citizen\, it's intrustion on the fetus\, ( and the pregant woman? ) OR A fetus is not a citizen\, it's intruston on the pregant woman."
99,"Did your thought process ever include the question : What choice does the  victim  have? Does the instinct to survive exist in the helpless?","You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too?"
100,"As for Cyber... he is not a Catholic but an atheist so I have no idea what he will think of this... Atheist + pro-life is quite strange\, but not unheard of.","See?"
101,"I was a wanted child\, a desired child. My parents planned for me.","you know what.. you are right\, any unwanted person should be killed. Lets start with nursing homes and then move on to mental health clinics."
102,"The genetic difference between human and his nearest relative\, the chimpanzee\, is at least 1.6 % Calculated out that is a gap of at least 48 million nucleotide differences that must be bridged by random changes.","Recent comparisons between the complete chimp genome and the human genome have found that possibly fewer than 3 million nucleotide differences exist in functional DNA."
103,"Don't quote yourself. What did I just say? Nothing is ever proven\, except in math. But\, yes\, papers are published all the time with loads of evidence pointing to the fact that birds evolved from dinosaurs.","Not one that a solid case can be made for. If it happened they would be numberless just as Darwin said."
104,"Hi\, i'm doing an research experiment for my isu project in sociology. So\, I did a survey and I hope you will fill it out. It will only take about 5 minutes or so. This survey is only towards young to older adults. But all of you can do it if you want : wink :. Anyways\, here's the survey! Please fill it out!","You're very welcome"
105,"How about you actually prove something for a change instead of expecting everybody else to do your work for you.","Stop trying to muddy the waters. I asked you to back up your claim that gun control is racist."
113,"Getting back to the original question... yes\, i think it is very reasonable to be against abortion and for a war.","Just like no one is really  for  abortions\, but they think that it's the woman's right to decide."
114,"Demon : Typical creationist big mouth\, can't keep the facts straight\, doesn't understand evolution and totally incapable of intelligent debate.","Because you are a Darwinist - this predictible insult testifies to my rightness."
115,"If more gun-control means more lives saved then more gun-control means more self preservation.","But gun control doesn't mean more lives saved so therefore\, your entire statement is wrong. Your idea of gun control works ONLY in an ideal world. In your ideal world\, everyone will give up their guns for the good of society."
116,"Do you know what is breast feeding? Human beings are mammalians?","Yes\, I know what it is. I also know of mothers who have never breast-fed."
117,"Of course\, what the mind is capable of creating\, it can then also * heal * as well\, thank goodness!  -- That is the good part of Teaching people. That we each can guide our mind towards nobly-humanitarian outcomes.","So can women can cure themselves? Is that what you mean? Or do you mean that once they forgive themselves they can move on to help other women do the same? thanks in advance..."
118,"I wouldn't want to make my daughter do anything in this scenario. I 'd be careful to explain all her options as free from bias as possible\, and then let her choose.","Me\, too. I 'd probably throw in some counseling as well\, just for starters."
119,"Not much of anything else either\, it would seem.","Translation =  I've closed my brain off and I've got not nothing."
183,"I've given yout a way to control crime and violence. At the same time not trample on the Constitution. The Constitution is a very noble document. Please stop trying to trash it. I've given you a way to control crime and violence. At the same time not trample on the Constitution. The Constitution is a very noble document. Please stop trying to trash it. I've","Well lets see here. You don ’ t want me to trash the constitution\, yet the constitution allows terrorists to take guns onto planes and really makes it easy for them. Do you think that our laws have shifted away from the constitution just for the fun of trashing it?"
184,"There was a first animal to fly\, a first mammal to take to the water\, a first multicellular creature. Of course\, the first multicellular creature was too stupid to realise it couldn't exist because otherwise some other cells would have done it first...","But no other animal that can fly has also conquered breathing under water as we have\, or has learned to travel on land faster than the fastest mammal can run. But we fly\, breathe underwater and travel faster than a cheetah as if it was second nature. No other animal in creation has attained what we have\, or even come close. As I said\, only humanity has evolved past having to survive in"
185,"The really important discovery is that the primary cilium detects signals\, which tell the cells to engage their compass reading and move in the right direction to close the wound\,  Christensen explains.","Purposefully communicating information as a means to an end... wound healing."
186,"Which lie is that?","That would be your outright lie that I advocate murder of anybody."
187,"Did she do anything wrong?","Yes\, she walked down the wrong alley\, alone. Would she have done so if she were not packin '?"
188,"Having asserted that transitional fossils abound\, Isaak ( a widely known evolutionist ) proceeds to cite Archaeopteryx","Who was Isaak? Where did he say this\, when did he say this?"
189,"my my you are up on the current events. Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here.","The the price of freedom = vigilance."
232,"ABB prohibits employees from carrying concealed ( or non-concealed for that matter ) firearms on company property. Looks like that worked out real well for them. My condolences to the victims and their families.","Darned Swiss gun laws!"
233,"In case you were wondering\, no one here has missed the fact that you're trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground.","No I'm not Kronus. I haven't made excuses for him or denied what he did. OP said he is a conservative Christian which is a lie and I'm exposing that lie for what it is. Unless she can prove he is anything more than a conservative secular Republican\, then he is no more a morally responsible person than an atheistic democrat."
234,"Why would they  necessarily  be Christian organizations?","Because most people are Christian."
235,"No one is arguing that a human fetus is not human. What is your point?","actually many argue this. More argue that the human fetus is not a person. I didn't know a living human could not be a person though."
236,"If when I was in the military\, I had suddenly stood up and said\,  Woah! Hey! I joined the military but it is against my religious beliefs to hurt others\, and this plan of action will hurt other people.  Should that be respected and I keep my  job ?","But the military is pretty much all a volunteer thing. It's not a hiring process -- employer/employee thing."
237,"Students Eric Harris\, 18\, and Dylan Klebold\, 17","Doesn't count. Took place in a  gun free zone . By law no guns are allowed there\, so by law this incident couldn't take place."
238,"Slugs and/or snails melt as they move. somewhat true\, have you ever paused to watch?","I 'll assume this is figurative since they do not literally melt."
253,"Are you saying you think the Supreme Court has the power to get rid of laws they feel are outta date?","No\, but they can change laws if they are unconstitutional. Them being irrelevant can however be played as a factor. Not an absolute one."
254,"Congressman Alan Grayson\, Florida : Think Progress Grayson ’ s Right : Under The Republican Plan\,  Don ’ t Get Sick ’ ( Or You Might Have To  ‘ Die Quickly ’ )","So you have a scumbag democrat screeching hate speech and we are supposed to believe its true! Get real baby even you don't believe this unless you have donated a vital organ associated with reasoning."
255,"Shooter\, so a cop is reporting to the scene and there you are packing a gun. How is the cop to know you're not the shooter?","Because hopefully you're going to shoot the guy\, drop your gun\, and put your hands out\, not run around in circles waving it like a maniac for a couple of minutes."
256,"Fight back\, by all means - when necessary. But if you can legally buy a gun for that purpose\, it means that your attacker is that much more likely to be armed as well.","The attacker is usually armed in spite of gun control laws. All they do is disarm the law abiding. Not to mention the lack of enforcement on criminals."
257,"I've also been explained how random mutations get selected\, which supposedly leads to evolution. I don't buy that either.","Well that does make sense given that one would not expect you to understand environmental pressures on mutations if you can't even understand erosion."
258,"I could say the same about heteros. If I have to accept heteros then heteros need to accept me.","So you're admitting openly that what is a normal occurrence within the human species is offensive to you."
259,"How can you tell the difference?","Simple. The big government people will tell you that it's in everybody's best interest."
274,"And primarily American evangelical protestants at that\, but that's a mouthful. What I'm asking really is that given they're promoting Jewish scripture\, why are they ignoring Jewish interpretation? It just seems bizare.","Well\, you will find claims amoung this group that 'If Jews understood their own scriptures\, they would accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior '\, and  Christians are fullfilled Jews ."
275,"Now\, it's RNA that seems to be  running the show.","It seems apparent that you didn't understand what you read. What you are saying is that a pressure regulatory valve on a steam engine is responsible for moving the train."
276,"Then explain to me why a pregnant woman was hit by a car not long ago leading to the death of both mother and baby. Resulting in a double vehicular homicide charge being leveled against the driver?","I dunno\, maybe it was in the third trimester?"
277,"why are you reffering to my arguments as  bullets ?","Because it is a bulleted list.... Surely you have Microsoft Word on your computer. Open it up.... go to Format and you will see  bullets and numbering  as it is a way to do a list."
278,"Too late. It's already been done. One thing I learned a while back is that a conservative will rarely\, if ever\, post anything that is contrary to his or her beliefs and the same can be said for the liberal. Both sides take every advantage to post something favorable to their ideologies.","and thus a reason to support balanced reporting. true\, there are indisputable facts. say 3000 died. but the interpretation of the facts are subjected to bias. the 3000 deserved to die as collaborators vs the 3000 were innocent and did not deserve to die."
279,"A foetus is a stage in human development\, something that begins at conception. It possesses unique DNA. But\, rather than address it as human\, we call it  person  on not a person.","Yes\, a foetus is human\, made of human cells\, and possessing of DNA. However\, it is no more a person than my kidney. Personhood implies mental existance\, something foetuses do not have before the end of the 2nd trimester."
280,"so what if a minority of americans wanted to legalize murder. this is rediculous.","Murder violates the rights of the murdered by relieving them of their life. That's why it's illegal."
302,"I disagree with your decision. It would have been better if you sucked it up and kept the kid. Even if you ended up on the street at least you wouldn't have killed anyone.","You don't beleive that it is possible to do something wrong to prevent a larger number of wrongs in the future? Do you think the ends can ever justify the means?"
303,"God is supposed to have given us dominion over the rest of creation etc.","And how do you know what other animals can analyze? Is that another supreme abilities of us humans? To read the minds of animals?"
304,"What if the jury is wrong?","Collateral damage. Just from what I've read and heard in the news\, I know he's guilty."
305,"I've been telling this board for months that the gene is not the player in biological change that everyone thinks it is.","Actually\, it is. There are multitudes of known characteristics that have been shown to be the result of a single point difference in the gene."
306,"Problem is that the right to marry is not a clear constitutional right. It is a right that has been interpreted by Courts on an illegitimate legal theory known as substantive due process.","I see -- in your opinion is it is  illegitimate \, therefore it must be so. I think I trust the legal opinions of the courts more\, but then\, they do occasionally make mistakes. It's just not at all obvious they've made one in this instance."
307,"Marriage is to promote children bearing and making a family unit.","But does anyone actually need a marriage to do this? No. Are there any laws stating one must be married before giving birth? No."
308,"Ridiculously wrong. A catapillar grows into a butterfly. A pup grows to a dog. A womb-trapped child grows into an adult human. They grow and develop and change.","But the point you miss is that a caterpillar is NOT a butterfly ; a puppy is NOT a full grown dog ; a ZYGOTE and a FETUS are NOT children."
323,"Very nicely stated in an editorial in today's New York Times : http : //www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/opinion/24sat3.html At last. Real people matter. Not tiresome maxims of blind\, unquestioning faith.","I'm not convinced that the fund people didn't turn their heads in China\, but I am otherwise in agreement with the editorial."
324,"Organs\, a nervious system\, a brain\, all these are the things that make us human...","Actually they are what make us animals. It's the DNA that determines that this particular animal will be a human."
325,"Because they would not be performing homosexual acts any longer.","So you've never repeated a sin?"
326,"I don't agree with the very first assertion in the audio clip\, that all life is derived from a SINGLE ancestor. We don't know that.","But it isn't an assertion of absolute truth. It is actually an assertion of the consensus of current scientific thought."
327,"http : //news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070531/... NfpmCZaggE1vAI","Nice to see that at least some of the states here in the US have some common sense and are at least heading towards equality for gay couples."

337,"Peeling\, with all due respect\, we have allegedly had 4 billion years of evolution on Earth since the first simple life supposedly appeared. Why must we make more assumptions based on what will happen in the next 10\,000 years?","Oh\, we don't have to - sorry\, I wasn't clear enough there. What I'm trying to do is correct your misapprehensions concerning common descent."
338,"I'm really curious to see who beleives in god for concrete reasons and who beleives in him by faith.","In reality\, there are no concrete'reasons'for believing in God. If you believe in God\, you believe based on faith. There is no incontrovertible physical evidence anywhere to even suggest that God exists... unless you first believe through faith that God exists."
339,"In theory the preventative care provided would allow us to catch conditions sooner\, resulting in decreased utilization of hospitals\, specialists\, and equipment.","Well this doesn't answer my question though. With this bill\, where is the money coming from? Are we cutting doctors jobs?"
340,"Why should Alice and Bob not be permitted to kill this chronically ill child?","See above."
341,"Local firearms dealers said they haven ’ t been able to keep that type of firearm on the shelves for months.

Gun sales have at least doubled\,  said the longtime owner of Hoffman","Is the Ammo Shortage the Result of a Government Conspiracy or an NRA Marketing Campaign?"
342,"It failed so it proves you and others wrong. Ultimately\, the efforts of the Jewish resistance fighters proved insufficient against the German forces.","And it still took an entire month for that whole division of well armed nazi soldiers to defeat a group of holdout jewish citizens\, who were poorly armed compared to the nazis."
343,"There were no valid reasons until the libs thought them up\, but I 'll set that aside for now. The question here is wether or not you think hunting is a valid reason for gun ownership.","I think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to. Every person ( with some exceptions ) has the right to keep and bear arms\, why you do it is your own business."
351,"Actually\, with more data that changes the number of assumptions required\, it is possible to reach a greater degree of certainty about something. The greater degree of certainty you reach\, the better you will be able to apply your findings.","Oh boy\, trying to tie Bayesian statistics to the number of assumptions! Nowhere in Bayesian analysis is there a term for number of assumptions."
352,"Here's an interesting hypothetical situation that I came across recently. It's one of those Catch-22\, you can only save one things. Say you are in a fertility clinic and it's burning down. Over in the corner there is a 2 year old child crying. In the other corner is a petri dish ( or test tubes if you like ) with 5 blastula embryos in it.

356,"you may\, but firstly\, that argument may well not fly - much of the grain going to these animals is essentially the trash left over from other production to begin with\, unfit for human consumption.","Nearly all the food humans eat today\, even in the Western world is GM including maize\, tomatoes\, and soy\, etc\, etc. used as ingredients in products such some soymilk."
357,"The thing I don't like about abortion is that it is the willful and intentional killing of an innocent human being.","Yes there is a reason to opposing it. It is called religion.

1781,"Yes\, our usage of those terms does differ markedly. You employ what I would call a narrative interpretation : design as a means to an end\, contrasted with evolution having no ultimate goal.","Yes\, I use  design  in a teleological sense. I have not contrasted 'design'with 'evolution '\, however. Only you have done that. And you are still using the word evolution as if it were some kind of causal force."
1782,"I have already proved the Big Bang to be a big dud\, so we need not go over this subject again ( unless Raastee or anyone else has objective evidence for this theory.","Wow\, you PROVED the Big Bang to be a big dud? I didn ’ t see this clear refutation of a longheld scientific theory written up in any of the peer reviewed scientific journals."
1783,"Notice how the places where guns are banned have the most massacres. Those who instituted laws preventing people on campus from defending themselves should be held partially liable for these crimes.","Your wrong. Airplanes and courthouses are gun free zones but these places never have massacres."
1784,"If they remain striaight then it's they were never really gay. Talk about biases.","No proof anyone ever went from gay orientation to straight orientation."
1785,"So these arguments I get from the likes of you and Iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness\, it isn't actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view. Of that\, there is no question.","Actually\, there is a great deal in question\, even in the passage at issue. It continues to amaze me how little you distinguish  the scriptural point of view  from your view of scripture."
1856,"With regard to slavery\, the Civil War was fought to establish the principle that  All men ( persons ) are created equal.","But the civil war wasn't fought for slavery. If you will recall the average northern soldier wasn't too fond of blacks\, and that is not only sugar coating it\, but saying it in the nicest terms possible."
1857,"then why in the world can't guns be regulated to protect against murder?","Because murder's already illegal and there's nothing more that can be done about it."
1858,"We would have more crime\, less morality","Actually it couldn't be any worse then it is right now. More people historically have died at the hands of religious wars then non-religion.

What is too complex to understand or explain now is credited to a higher being.","Oh no\, it's not too complex for us to understand.

1861,"I never said that\, i just think that it's a bit selfish to kill an unborn baby when you are cabable of looking after it.","Well\, I think it's selfish that you want a woman to not terminate a fetus that possibly could develop into a baby becaue you think that every woman is capable of looking after it."
1862,"People complain about imports but then buy them. People complain about the little toys in Wal-Mart being made by cheap labor while they drive their imported cars.","the majority of Japanese cars sold in the US are also assembled in the US and thus provide Americans with thousands of jobs at these plants."
1898,"echolocation is superior to vision because it works no matter how much light exists. Optical vision only functions if there's light\, and low and behold\, most bats feed and live in darkness.","If echolocation is superior to vision\, why haven't more animals evolved this fantastic ability?"
1899,"In abstract\, it might be tempting to imagine that irreducible complexity simply requires multiple simultaneous mutations -- - that evolution might be far chancier than we thought\, but still possible. Such an appeal to brute luck can never be refuted. Yet it is an empty argument.","So where in there does Behe say that brute luck is actually impossible? Nowhere. Where in there does Behe say that brute luck is actually impossible? Nowhere. Where in there does Behe say that brute luck is actually impossible? Nowhere.

1902,"That men would vote on a law that can place a womens'life in peril\, is beyond me.","We all know of course that the partial birth abortion procedure is never medically necessary to save the life of the mother. Now\, you seem to believe that men are just trying to endager women. '' Those men just want to opress women. They just don't understand. Men are just pieces of XXXXXX. I hate men...  The bill overturned by the  judges"
1903,"You wrongly use Occam's Razor as well. If the document is well preserved\, has many copies\, has copies relatively close to the original\, etc\, then the most likely assumption we can make is that the document itself is a valid source.","I think extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. There is not  overwhelming documentation  for the gospel story. There is next to none."
1904,"All previous attempts to explain how the process works have failed. Since no-one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and can not even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor\, are you not teaching your opinion\, sir? Are you now not a scientist\, but a priest?","The first sentence is inaccurate\, as is the first part of the second sentence. Therefore the quesion of 'are you not teaching your opinion\, sir?'is moot. The theory of evolution has nothing to do with opinion. It matters not whether or not anyone believes in it. Evolution has been observed. There is no known evidence to suggest that evolution does not occur."
1933,"icky the hypocrisy smells. Louisiana Republican Senator David Vitter\, one of the leading proponents of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage\, has just apologized for his  serious sin  after his phone number appeared in the records of a DC Madam who ran an escort/prostitution service.","People with big egos have libidos that keep up. what's new? It's an unfortunate accompanying characteristic."
1934,"Basic law 101 : you can be driving by the time you're 15 and a half. We are speaking mostly of 16 and 17 year old girls. Many of which cars and jobs.","Basic law 101 : You can drive by 15 1/2 with A LICENSED ADULT OVER 25 IN THE CAR. Not 18 or 21\, but 25 so it isn't a matter of potential peers watching each other. And your opening post referred to 14 year olds or above\, as it shows below."
1935,"That is amazing. I find it crazy that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of the babies that are aborted. Abortion is murder.","Yea\, and so is gardening. Both are  murdering  living things. Both do not mentally exist. A strand of DNA is the only difference\, which isn't very much."
1936,"Then you have mutations\, which are all either neutral or deleterious.","Or helpful."
1937,"Substantially\, that logic dictates that much of radioactivity shouldn't be taught as we didn't come up with it. If we decided based on heritage what we should teach in science\, we 'd be leaving out vast amounts of chemistry\, biology and physic from science.","And once you build one straw man\, you tend to substantially build even bigger ones."
1938,"Astronomers have debated Arp's assertion that quasars are related to peculiar galaxies since the late 1960's.","Why didn't they  fire  and  bar  him in the sixties?"
1939,"Montalban Why do you find it necessary to misrepresent what everyone says?","Kerry is pro-choice. He is in favour of allowing abortions to continue. It matters not why. That's not what we're discussing. It matters not why."
1982,"Statis is the norm not the exception.","And that remark is relevant because? Just to inform you once again\, the word is  stasis.  You make yourself look ignorant and foolish when you can't even spell correctly. However\, stasis is the norm in a stable environment."
1983,"Now onto the mother dieing if giving birth this is juss my opinion and belief if iwas the mother i would have first married a husband who would raise the kid up right after i died. Also i would know that i have lived some odd years and know its my turn to allow another to live. For i have had a full life and the baby deserves a chance.","Oh how wonderful for you. You can say something like this so easily without having to consider anything but what someone else would have to do. Are you a man or woman? As a man you would never have to live by the advice your giving but would you so willingly follow your advice if your wife had to make the choice? How about your mom? How about your sister? How about your child?"
1984,"No\, I'm saying it's OK because abortion is legal in this country. I was just pointing out that it's also legal to execute a convicted killer\, and it's fine and dandy to declare wars where many people will die. '' Thall shalt not kill\, unless there is a war .","Thou Shalt Not Kill. Seems to be a pretty convenient verse to throw around. Does anyone who actually quotes the Bible bother to look up the Hebrew meanings? I don't think so."
1985,"Even if they are women. Time and time again I am disgusted with the callousness in which so-called  pro-life  persons seek to ignore the plight of women around the world who have suffered enormous health consequences from pregnancy.","After a Devastating Birth Injury\, Hope By DENISE GRADY DODOMA\, Tanzania & # 8212 ; Lying side by side on a narrow bed\, talking and giggling and poking each other with skinny elbows\, they looked like any pair of teenage girls trading jokes and secrets."

1987,"Abstinence until marriage is still the best way.","Its not very risky anymore..."
1988,"Why do you want the people to vote to take other people marriages away? I do not understand your reasoning on this.","Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves."

2047,"You're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on. They decide when you get to come in and go out\, and the police have decided to abandon you rather than come to your aid. And Canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or out right illegal depending on just where you life.","So? He had a shotgun. You're saying that if it were legal to these Indians that would have solved the problem?"

2070,"ur definition of evolution is incorrect.","Actually\, his definition of evolution is exactly correct. In fact\, I notice that you even acknowledge that he is correct in the last sentence of the paragraph. If you knew that his definition was correct\, even if it is the definition of biological evolution\, why would you state otherwise?"
2071,"A right to personal autonomy or self-ownership is a neccessary component of any consistent rule-based moral system in which man can live\, since it is impossible to give or get permission to make use of your body prior to using it to get that permission.","No they don't.

2072,"Majority backs gay marriage\, ballot measure in poll : DC Agenda Keep in mind that this is an opinion poll\, so take it for what its worth\, but it seems to indicate that the people of DC wanted to vote on this issue.","let's have an up or down vote on your marriage rights too Lurch"

2158,"I m against gay marriage and have been happily married for 31 years\, thereby disproving your BS. NEXT!!!","Congratulations. You are now part of a minority group. Marriage tends to either work or it doesn't. I know\, brilliant observation. What I mean is either the couple is together for decades or spend x amount of years being unhappy until the unhappy is more than the baggage of divorce."
2159,"I can't take men's position on abortion seriously b/c they can spout off all they want ; however their viewpoint must be affected somewhat by the fact that they will never actually have to make the decision themselves.","so\, barren women can not have a valid point of view nor women in the stage of menopause because it does not affect them personally."
2160,"I would feel discriminated against\, and  morality  is easily linked to religion ( especially in these cases ). If I were discriminated against on religious grounds I 'd feel I have a pretty good case ( not necessarily a good chance of winning in this christian/ignorant nation ).","Maybe you need to take a hard look at where your rights start infringing on the rights of others.

Could we possibly just accept that we got here"
2163,"Show me how a cell could evolve randomly :","Very\, very slowly\, latterly from something almost like a cell\, and before that from something a bit less like a cell\, and so forth. The cell is not an irreducible organic 'atom '\, and did not have to spring into existence in one go."
2199,"Of course\, teaching kids  Stop\, don't touch\, leave the area\, tell an adult  is pro-gun indoctrination with chilling similarities to indoctrination of North Korean children.","And the same people that believe that are the ones that keep saying that teaching about alternative lifestyles isn't."
2200,"And he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun. This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth\, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart.","Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns."
2201,"Is global warming a real threat or is it just a hoax?","It seems that the high priest of Global Warming is so unconcerned about its reality that In the past year\, Gore ’ s home burned through 213\,210 kilowatt-hours ( kWh ) of electricity\, enough to power 232 average American households for a month. http : //news.newsmax.com/?

2231,"Most people are probably not aware that NY has had a gun registry for what? About 20 years? and it has never helped solve a crime.","Actually its one of the oldest gun laws on the books.

4491,"So what? Most of them are still getting killed with guns.","Most of them happening in the inner cities of Illinois\, New York and California - states where the restricted access of firearms is supposedly designed to keep acts like these from happening."
4492,"So you are saying that genetics has nothing to do with genetics? why don't you address my point?... do you disagree? How many genetic diseases do you know of that disallow people to breed? How many of your friends can't breed?","The dead ones can't\, and things like Cystic Fibrosis or Severe Combined Immunodeficiency are going to kill you easily before you reach sexual maturity without medical care."
4493,"the child in the womb feels pain.. when you put the needle up there to try to give the child anestesia in the womb\, the child moves away to not get stuck by the needle.","Why should the woman be forced to care for this child against her will?"
4494,"if i were on an isalnd i would ask myself how did these things get here? chance? probably not because when do two things happen exactly the same way..","Actually\, we have a pretty good idea of how life populates islands. And yes\, it is pretty much by chance that things get carried to islands by any of several means."
4502,"There  s not so much I could discuss as I don  t really know much about the US constitution. But as it seems to be quite few responses I thught I could try to stir the pot a little.","Ahh\, another\, not of this country trying to stir the pot. At least you are honest and portend to know little of what our Constitution is or does as for it's role in American government."
4503,"what are your ideas for a same sex wedding ceremony that is not religious and is also not to  heterosexual  but is still is a nice ceremony?","The lutheran ceremony is pretty cool just change a few words to gender nutral. Also the Cathedral of hope http : //www.cathedralofhope.com in dallas and the MCC in general has some very nice Holy union ceremonies"
4504,"A women by the name of Mary Anne Warren said this","You got to love it. Always fascinating when stuff is dishonestly taken out of context. Normally\, we see this from creationists\, but you are by no means the first prolifer who has engaged in this practice. But lets look at it"
4505,"So.... where is your tautology\,","I think that if Montalban is anything\, he is opportunistic. Someone ( Ungerdunn I think ) pointed out to him that the phrase\,  survival of the fittest  reduces to a tautology. As seems to be his bent\, Montalban generalized that fact to claim that somehow evolution is a tautology."
4506,"South Dakota's governor has signed the bill prohibiting doctors from performing abortions in the state of South Dakota. Oh happy day!!! The Supreme Court needs the opportunity to reverse its unprincipled decision in Roe.","So taking peoples rights away is an american value? I think I will push for legislation to make cancer surgery illegal."
4507,"There is no requirement in the 2nd amend that a person must be in a militia to bear arms. Also tanks\, fighter aircraft and yes even rockets are legal to own. People collect these items.","One point I would like to make is that rockets are not legal to own\, unless they are demil-ed\, and the same goes for tanks and aircraft. They are called Destructive Devices under the NFA\, and are regulated heavily."
4508,"Stenger concludes\, after reflecting on the long history of misrepresentation and manipulation of scientific fact regarding God\, that our world actually is worse off as a result of religious faith.","So religion must be systematically abandoned and eradicated\, not completely\, just enough to be out of the public and political realm\, leaving atheism as king."
4558,"Here is Hans Fricke's own story regarding the investigation into the coelacanths natural habitat which Nat Geo's story is based upon. And notice the last paragraph in the story.","Of course they didn't see it walk\, it's a different genus altogether."
4559,"no surprise that an industry run by criminals keeps the black market well stocked with guns while being cheered by the gun lobby","Alleged isn't the same thing as hard and provable evidence. So this is nothing more than supposition\, theory\, hearsay\, musings\, etc. Come back when you've got some hard evidence!"
4560,"The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence\, and it's simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures ( from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God ) were indisputably true\, then ID would be falsified. There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins","Please explain to me how radiometric dating is based on the presupposition that there is no God."
4561,"The creationists are hammered into a squelchy mess on every single occasion! They have no evidence to back up their position\, and very little knowledge of the subject\, so lose every time.","Can anyone say\,  Fly By!"
4562,"The lack of transitional series can not be explained as being due to the scarcity of material.","If transitional species is a large issue to overcome\, I will post my rather lengthy explanation of the lack of transitional species\, but perhaps it should suffice to say that we have found some evidence of transitional species\, and even if we had not\, the lack of transitional species provides no evidence of creationism."
4563,"That didn't seem to hold up did it? Just because Mass and Cal. said it was alright did make it alright for the rest of the country.2 Liberal states didn't push the rest of the country to follow like sheep to a slaughter.","Actually\, it has. The last time I checked\, well still have gay marriages in Massachusetts."
4564,"Biology IS evolution.","Oh really... biology : a branch of knowledge that deals with living organisms and vital processes I don't see the synonym  evolution  anywhere in that definition. Some biologists may study evolution\, but biology is NOT evolution."
4607,"I was watching the Bill Maher show today and they had Jane Fonda on. She mentioned that she has recently become a Christian and that HER god is one that supports a womens right to choice. Now there are so many problems with this that I don't even know where to start.","Well here is a christian who supports abortion. I personally HAVE had an abortion. I had it several years\, and while it was an extremely hard and emotional decision\, I chose what was best for me. I was engaged ( now married )\, and both my then-fiance and I were on birth control ( I was on the pill and he used condoms ). Unfortunately\, despite those precautions\,"
4608,"Today's various forms of dissolution of marriage\, free unions\, trial marriages as well as the pseudo-matrimonies between people of the same sex are instead expressions of anarchic freedom which falsely tries to pass itself off as the true liberation of man\,  he said.","Just can't satisify  them thar'Moralizers.  I remember the election of 1960\, and how many were worried about JFK taking his  orders from Rome.  Maybe that is why we are a land of laws\, not of men."
4609,"Well for what it's worth\, the police prefer to use AR-15 Carbines\, MP-5 9mms\, and either Mossberg or Remington 12ga when they are serving a no-knock warrant on your house ( or the wrong house next door ) in the middle of then night.

4610,"Nope. He was a great man who didn't believe in your cradle to grave liberalism.","A sign like that would hardly be nessecary where I live. We have very restrictive gun-laws and hardly anyone owns a gun. And no\, people does not discipline themselves."
4611,"You are in a loud minority\, railing against the irrational hoards about you.","Being in the minority or in the majority is irrelevant. Belief has no bearing on reality."
4612,"I just became aware of a new movement : http : //www.godnotguns.org/ And\, it made me aware of a very  XXXXXX  conundrum in the philosophy of the right\, their ceaseless screaming or babbling about : Gays! God! Guns!","Actually\, Simone\, if you spend more time on their website and research a little deeper\, you will find that they are also  right wing wingnuts  but they happen to want  sensible  gun policies in order to eliminate violence ( clearly delineated from war ) with the use of guns in all countries. Essentially they are the ones you are griping about and stereotyping. Provide a decent"

4649,"If you are unhappy about the peppered moth\, try the Polar Bear. The fossil record is remarkably complete\, and the mechanism of the evolution of the Polar Bear from the Brown Bear remarkably clear.","Way back when I was an undergraduate my professor of evolutionary biology told us about a careless zoo keeper that put polar bears and brown bears in the same pen during a remodeling."
4650,"Does the term  evolution  refer to ONLY the  advances  of life over time?","Depends on the usage. Generally\, it just refers to the Theory of Evolution or a change in allele frequencies in a population."
4651,"What's the difference between humans and chimps? According to the blowhards in the scientific world for the past 60 years\, they said it was genetic mutations. But according to these three articles\, including a September 2006 Science article it's cooked food and fire..... you see these things cause our genes to be expressed differently.... We think gene expression is a major part of what separates chimps and","The article is saying that it was genetic changes. Changes in genes encoding certain transcription factors is what caused changes in the expression of other genes."
4652,"I'm for gun control. I believe you should have a steady hand\, firm grip\, calm breath\, and a smooth pull.","Very well put."
4653,"You do realize that the rules are supposed to be absurd\, to point up the absurdity of a recent court ruling\, right?","NO I mean every word of what I type. If they institute these rules I will back off gay claim to marriage and accept that marriage is about children."
4654,"I wonder how a modern court would view the testimony of 500 credible witnesses to a supernatural event?","A modern court requires signed affidavits or sworn testimony. These five hundred people remain unnamed and carry on with their lives as if it never happened."
4655,"Do you believe that\, if we have the technology\, we should resurrect the dead to walk the Earth as zombies?","haha\, good question."
4712,"I would be interested in know who was the first creationist to finally accept that natural selection is a real phenomenon\, and when they accepted it. I don't know his name\, but I 'll research it for you and tell you in a week or so.","By the way\, I do believe that natural selection was accepted before Darwin. It was believed that natural selection killed the  freaks  and ensured that a population of organisms stayed the same ; in other words\, I think I recall that it was originally believed that natural selection kept populations from changing. It was Darwin who understood that natural selection would actually lead to changes in the species."
4713,"So? He had a shotgun. You're saying that if it were legal to these Indians that would have solved the problem?","Yes that would solve the problem wouldn't it\, worked the first time around\, I say that because we ( U.S. ) are compared to the wild west.

4714,"All athiesm is\, is a lack of theism\, period.","Ha! That is classic! So Nihilism proves God???"
4715,"So contemporary arguments for intelligent design in both biology and the physical sciences are not only testable ; they make predictions and are falsifiable in principle. Of course\, if the arguments are true\, then they are falsifiable only in principle\, but not in fact ( hardly a weakness in a scientific theory ). We have given only two examples here. There are many other design arguments in biology\, origin-","http : //www.evolutionnews.org/2006/01... rica.html # more"

4718,"Reptile develops wings. These thing are completely useless on a dino\, they evolve right the hell away.","Something that would let you become a better hunter or escape from hunters is  completely useless ? I don't think so. Even so\, how is  completely useless  a deteriment to evolution? Our fingernails are  completely useless  and yet we still have them.

4736,"Abortion does not fit the definition of murder.","If you define a fetus as a child\, as AMD seems to by his/her statement\, then yes\, it does fit the definition."
4737,"But to take the Apostle's analogy further\, if I see something\, and know what it is\, and you can't measure it\, because you weren't there\, doesn't make what I see false... as you would believe - seeing as you seem to suggest that in the physical world truth is what can be measured/tested.","Again your failure to understand what science is and how it works."
4738,"Umpteen scientific disciplines can be dwarfed by emotion and money\, both of which saturate evolutionary study.","Because it works. How much money is pumped into microchip design and production?"
4739,"on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it?","Why so many claims in opposition? I make a single claim\, that can be refuted through logic\, if it's fallacy. But the claim is correct."
4754,"Anyone who sticks to beliefs that a god created the earth just 6\,000 years ago is an XXXXX. People are free to believe that a god created the Earth billions of years ago though without deserving the  XXXXXX  label. Hope this clarifies things for you.","Thanks\, Clive\, you're a good sport. Of course I can't agree with the XXXXX part."
4755,"Possibly\, but also aren't the people most likely to start  legitimate  business selling these drugs the people who are doing it already? I mean\, these are the people who already have a supply line and infrastructure.","So? Isn't that exactly what we would want : people who conduct legal business instead of illegal business? That means less crime\, even if organized crime is still into other things. Making a drug illicit effectively creates another market for organized crime. Look at alcohol and prohibition. Alcohol was a huge market for organized crime back in prohibition days."
4756,"Whether or not there are innaccuracies in the Bible is hottly debated\, but it is not really the point I was trying to make. I was simply attempting to point out the different viewpoints\, not debate on the validity of the Bible. Please read\, take a deep breath\, and think before you reply from simple emotion.","I know you think I was acting emotional with my post and it really is hard to tell whether someone is being emotional over a forum since it is so impersonal."
4757,"They are doing a fine job of trying to convince all of us that their behavior is  normal . TV shows\, movies\, magazines\, etc. are loaded with gay characters as an agenda to make you accept them. Don't buy it! Write to the media and tell them you won't stand for it.","Actually I really don't depend on the entertainment industry to give me a realistic picture of anything. I highly recommend you don't\, either. What I know about gay people is from knowing gay people."
4758,"There is nothing inherently irrational about the theory of evolution being used to explain life in the physical unviverse\, yet creation begins with an irrational premise\, that we can  know  about the  unknowable . It can certainly be a false theory\, however\, you can rationally show that it is or is not ( to the degree determined by your evidence ).","Actually\, the whole basis for modern science depends on the assumption that the universe was made by a rational creator."
4759,"If only she 'd been allowed to have a gun she could have what? Shot or threatened to shoot someone? '' Boys and girls as young as 10 \, the story says. They threw  rocks and eggs  at her house. They don't kill you for that in England\, Texas maybe.","Shooting people for throwing rocks and eggs at houses that is."
4760,"I'm sure there have been more repeat murderers than innocent people put to death. As far as the cost goes\, is that really an issue? Execution Room = $ 10\,000 Stainless Steel Table = $ 2\,000 Leather Straps = $ 200 Lethal Injection Chemicals = $ 5\,000","Actually the room\, straps\, and table are all multi-use. And the drugs only cost Texas $ 86.08 per execution as of 2002."
4761,"I don't think the point was to come up with an exact number of gun laws.","And your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source. To contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman."
4762,"Why on earth would a woman come out now\, admit to an abortion she had 30 years ago\, when it was illegal\, and become the focus of unscrupulous media attention for the next year?","Probably the same reason why John Kerry won't disclose his medical and senate attendance records."
4763,"As for the other gods\, well since they don't interact with our world they don't really matter at all. they could just as well not be there\, and life as we know it would be the same. a question that asks  is there a god?  is answered  it doesn't matter .","Very true\, especially since when someone asks  is there a God  they are most likely really asking  does the God in which I believe exist"
4764,"When that occurs is variable.","So why can not juvenile crimes which would otherwise be death penalty eligible be treated on a case-by-case basis?"
4765,"A theory is not a fact\, no matter how much evidence may support the theory.","Evolution is both a verified phenomenon and a biological Theory."
4766,"At least we're on the right side of the issues\, [ trying to shoot down another big-government\, bureaucratic\, wallet-busting\, job-killing\, liberty-gutting abortion.","More like the wrong side of the issues\, ever in search of more money with the health insurance industry\, I 'd say. Off the blood of your fellow Americans. Shoot down sounds appropriate though."
4767,"I'm an atheist pretty much the same reason you are an atheist ( except for going to a religious school.","My outburst was meant to show that even a seven year bombardment of religious propaganda can be ineffective if no reasons whatever are advanced for reaching the conclusions that the theists desire."
4789,"The organism can survive in the environment by a loss of genetic information i.e. the loss of a function\, for example the loss of wings of a beatle on a windy island helps it to survive. If they had wings\, they may be blown into the ocean and drown. Over time\, you may get a population of wingless beatles - the adaption would be mutation by natural selection.","Except that your picture is balderdash. I presume that you mean beetle\, since a Beatle is one of the fab four. The wingless beetles of which you speak actually have wings."
4790,"You seem to have trouble creating working links. Here is a corrected link to your quote.","You seem to think one example is the norm."
4791,"Rhodesian man\, in less than 85 years\, ages from approximately 11\,000 years old to up to 400\,000 years old! – all in the name of political correctness. It ’ s the epitome of what they stand for.","In the past 85 years\, dating has drastically improved. You're falsely saying that scientists have readjusted the date because it suits their timeline\, rather then noticing that dating has improved and new techniques have been used on virtually every piece we have today. Learn to use Oczzam's razor."
4792,"Creationism is a religion\, and Evolutionism is science. Why would people be teaching religion in a public school. Isnt that illegal?","Apparently not. I live in Utah and every public school has a building on the grounds called the seminary. In seminary class they teach of all things the book of Mormon. A Mormon is basically a financial Christian with a whole other book of incredibly stupid poop in it."
4793,"Its  guess and check method doesn ’ t work as essentially there are infinite different possible explanations available to check and so the chances of coming across the correct one are effectively zero.","But that's not even how  creation science \, or any religiously motivated science works. There is no checking involved - what I mean by that is that answers are always ad hoc."
4794,"Incapable of arguing without relying on the fallacy of changing the subject\, false dichotomies ( if not A\, therefore B )\, and generally unable of actually discussing their beliefs on those beliefs'merits?","You mean Intelligent Design\, and straight forward logical\, rational\, common sense arguments that require reason to move to the next step\, instead of ideological consensus... huh? go figure... Proponents of ID usually don't argue religiosity or scripture\, they let the empirical evidence prove it\, funny... that is what true science has always done. Verify the obvious\, not ignore it in favor of some"
4795,"the biological life of a homo sapien begins when the sperm fertilizes the egg and the newly created zygote begins to reproduce cells.","You do realise that by your definition\, identical twins are the same 'life '? You do also realise that a freshly fertilised egg does not meet the standard criteria for judging whether something is alive?"
4866,"My point in starting the thread is not merely that Christians fall short of their aspirations. No.... this is worse. Because this particular U.S. Senator\, an avowed conservative Christian\, has actively worked to restrict the rights of others to marry\, supposedly in the name of  protecting  or  defending  marriage\, while at the same time undermining his own marriage. He makes","People like this guy\, and Henry Hyde\, Newt Gingrich\, Robert Livingston\, and so many others happen to be right wing republicans.... isn't that peculiar?"
4867,"It appears that a Law or theorem is fundamentaly based on faith. If you couldn't build on the belief that something will happen\, we 'd be stuck never forming new hypostheses. You may have it backwards.","You really have a strange definition of faith. Scientific laws require reproducible results ( patterns ). That's how they got to be laws."
4868,"Scientists have turned to chickens to help them understand why some people are struck down by severe allergies.","I'm not keen on them describing things as living fossils ( the term is misleading ) the possibilities and implications of this are fascinating."
4869,"I have heard lately of people who actually argue that Jesus did not exist. I decided to start this thread to see what everyone thinks. Do you think Jesus existed? Do you think he existed as described in the bible ( Son of God\, etc. )? If not\, why not? Here is my view - the Bible tells me that Jesus existed\, and is the Son of God\, as well as my Lord and Savior","I believe Jesus is a role model for the human race.

4872,"What should the world look like with the very different set of phy [ s ] ics\, chemistry and biology principles?","It wouldn't. Altering any of the fundamental universal constants changes them all. We wouldn't be considering some small change here and small change there."
4894,"I can understand the argument that gun laws may infringe on some individual freedom\, but I don  t really understand what the constitution has to do with it. Sure\, its much harder to make a change in the constitution\, but this doesn  t really affect wether the change should be done or not.","The difference\, Eddie is simply this. If the Constitution needs to be changed\, the founders instigated a means to do so. Said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done\, has been given much thought and study."
4895,"The authors claim their book is being rejected on political grounds\, '' Koss said.  But these are criticisms of content and quality. ''","The guy sounds like he's trying to make a political argument out of this so he can sell more books."
4896,"The only thing that has changed is the population ratio\, assumably by * natural selection *. Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means.","Hello\, Nu Leader. Nor was the peppered moth example ever meant to  prove  evolution. One important part of the theory of evolution is the hypothesis that natural selection is the major driving force behind it. So\, the peppered moth observations were meant to show that natural selection can have a significant effect on the relative frequency of genotypes."
4897,"is that for you to use these primate fossils as any actual evidence at all that a REAL chain of lineage from those ancient primates to modern man exists is impossible to prove.","See above regarding the nature of proof. What other plausible explanation is there? We have transitional fossils from so many strata between so many species\, genetic markers in extant species indicating common ancestry - all life on earth dances to the common-descent beat. Yet you want us to make a special exception for humans\, despite the exact same consillience between fossil evidence\, genetic evidence\, everything."
4898,"Now you are making assumptions. I said God did not tell them the different categories of animals\, I did not say that God deliberately kept information from them.","No\, they are the same. God diliberately kept information fro them because He knew they would not understand\, just like you would deliberately keep information not pertinent to you children because they will not understand."
4899,"It's easy to come up with scenarios where you think a gun is the only escape\, but then there are plenty of alternatives where guns take lives unnecessarily\, be they because children get hold of them\, or nutcases\, or someone who's just had a bad day.","So\, everyone who dies in a stabbing/beating/shooting is just\, stupid? Maybe they wanted to die?"

4923,"The bible is nothing more than a book of morals meant to give those who have nothing to live for a reason to live.","And those who respect themselves and others don't need that book of morality."
4924,"If God exists\, and he wanted his existence proven\, he could prove it. Likewise\, if he wanted to have an impact\, he could. I will agree with 1 and 3 if you add  as things stand now \, or words to that effect.","We can not prove the existence of God for\, by definition\, he dwells in a reality outside our own. Likewise\, I can not prove the existence of a Flying Shoe in Hyperspace\, nor can I disprove it\, but I can prove that the Flying Shoe does not exist in our world because it exists\, by definition\, in Hyperspace. I can make up anything I want and say it"
4925,"I would consider a transitional fossil one which contains parts from both the upper and lower class evolutionary forms it links. However\, it must contain many of these\, and I imagine a few would have  melded  during the process.","So what's wrong with the lineages provided? Define  melding ."
4926,"Why do I think they are popular books\, and not peer reviewed scientific articles?","Because you know the peer review process is biased. Anything submitted for peer review with a recognizable name like Dembski or Behe will be automatically rejected before the first word is read."
4927,"Can you please provide a cite in the Constitution that supports the notion that a Supreme Court Justice nominee has the power to declare that any case is  settled law  and the subsequent power to make it so? I didn't think so.","Reading Difficulties\, huh? There's a cure for that. It's called school. Perhaps you should go there....."
4928,"No Electrolyte\, science lies! here is the undisputed truth : Noah and his three sons traveled the globe\, collected two representatives of each species ( or seven of each clean species depending on the chapter ). They crammed these critters in a sea worthy vessel made exclusively of gopher wood.","Thanks for clearing that up Mutz. I've always known that putting every living species on the earth in one boat is a heckuva lot easier to believe than those foolish fossils."
4992,"Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others\, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population\, but it can't create any new information.","What are you talking about? Please define information. What does  new  information have to do with natural selection or evolution? Evolution is NOT defined by evolutionary biologists as an increase in information. So I ask again\, please define information in a meaningful way as it applies to DNA and the genome of an organism."
4993,"Human's wrote the bible. Not all words in the bible were inspired by God. They are simply fallable man's interpretation of a greater intelligence.","Oh I quite agree. Unfortunately\, not everyone is able to see it as such. I was admitting to those who don't that it does appear that God confirms their homosexual prejudices. To back Traveler up however\, I don't buy the 'closet case'answer myself."
4994,"Where do you get the figure of 500\,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married?","Actually\, I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only\, but after reading the CBO report\, I see that I wasn't far off. They predicted 600\,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed."
4995,"I suspect that this will not be considered reasoned debate as it is disagreement with the anti DP stance.","But you are forgetting life-without-parole ( and I do mean WITHOUT parole ). With life without parole\, there is also no recidivism."

Still\, the war wasn't aganist slavery."

8108,"Because if evolution can not explain all changes it is false\, Unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created. Is that what you mean?","That's just not true.

9510,"Is this a diversionary tactic? I don't see any claim being made about those types of weapons being sold in US gun stores.","Not at all\, I'm simply forcing those making the argument to address the undeniable facts."
9511,"Often abortion supporters convey their message as one of championing the cause of freedom of choice and resistance of the oppression of others values on women.","I can't speak for anyone else\, but I support any choice that the woman wants to make. No\, I don't support forced abortions anywhere\, I don't support what's going on in China and India because they're still taking a choice away from the women."
9512,"Why are trying to prove that God exists or does not exist based on the design of our eye?","Except for possible exception of a couple evangelistic atheists\, the design argument is from the creationist side. It is pretty old being first stated by William Paley. Darwin respected Paley and thought his arguments beautiful until he actually started looking at reality ( Darwin also lived in that same rooms at Christ's College\, Cambridge that Paley did )."

9650,"So why should you care about their non-scientific beliefs in a debate on science? Most people who believe in evolution do so because of science\, so their non-scientific beliefs are irrelevant.","If a scientist doesn't believe his test results are accurate\, and expects me to place my life savings on his project would that not be pretty stupid."

9652,"The philosophy of experimental science...began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith\, not the knowledge\, that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operation... It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science\, which professionally has little to do with faith\, owes its origins to an act of faith","Origins of science\, whether truly started by those of faith or not\, is irrelevant.

( 1 ) When does personhood begin? ( 2 ) Who gets to make such arbitrary\, moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman? Both are legitimate issues of contention."

9693,"I'm not going to get into a religious debate\, but I can appreciate someone taking a religious stance against it. Why do I think it is wrong? I think its wrong in the sense that it is treated as equal to heterosexualty. Its not\, it can not be\, and that is no ones fault but natures. Nature doesn't allow homosexual sex to create life\, to reproduce","No\, I wasn't looking for religious morality\, I was looking for general morality\, so your argument was the kind I wanted to debate."
9694,"When the needs of the two are in conflict this is unavoidable.","It is so the womans decision. If the baby is in the womb they haven't experience life\, so how can they miss it. And if they are a so called  soul  then they will come out somewhere else."
9695,"Creationists always refer to  random chemical reactions  as if there was anything random about chemical reactions.","Yes you are right : chemical reactions are not random.

9709,"Other branches of science have been bent to accommodate Darwinian evoluton.","So you solely have a problem with the theory of evolution\, but anything in science that doesn't involve this theory seems sound to you. Correct? 2 questions : If you trust the scientific method in the rest of science\, and you feel the processes are sound\, how do you account for the overwhelming acceptance of evolution?"
9717,"What I found is in the 10 pages of threads in this forum\, not a single one talks about Creationism as valid based on its own merits.","actually some did talk about the complexity of life as well as irreducible complexity even though it may not be mentioned in the title"

Lets review several points here : 1 ) The need to display current information.

9741,"The justification comes from this being a scientific fact. This evidence has been posted before by chloe\, but here it is again for your enjoyment.","But it's not a  fact  unless you've defined what you mean by  person.
